                The OpenChat system is composed of canister smart contracts running on the Internet
                Computer which provides chat functionality. The canisters provide an API and serve
                the assets for the OpenChat web app, and going forwards, will allow 3rd-party
                services to integrate chat. The following diagram shows the OpenChat system in
                orange with its various external dependencies. The blue boxes are services running
                on the Internet Computer and the gray boxes are off-chain.

                The OpenChat system architecture has been driven by both the requirements and by the
                current and anticipated future characteristics of the Internet Computer.

            <p>The OpenChat system comprises the following</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Groups</strong> - a canister for each chat group which holds the group members

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Group Index</strong> - a canister which holds the registry of groups and
                    creates and upgrades group canisters

                    <strong>Notifications</strong> - a canister which holds a queue of notifications
                    and a map of device subscriptions for each user
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proposals bot</strong> - a canister which can create OC proposals groups
                    for the NNS and SNSs and syncs proposals from NNS/SNS governance canisters
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Online user aggregator</strong> - a canister which records the online status
                    of OC users and periodically syncs them with the user index
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cycles dispenser</strong> - a canister which is responsible for topping up
                    the other canisters with cycles
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notifications relay</strong> - an oracle hosted on an AWS ec2 instance which
                    polls the Notifications canister and sends web push notifications

                    the user index canister for user verification requests and sends SMSs containing
                    verification codes
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The <ExternalLink href={"https://github.com/open-ic/open-chat"}
                    >OpenChat source code</ExternalLink> is built into the WASMs used by each type of
                OpenChat canister in a repeatable way using docker. Anyone who pulls the OpenChat source
                code and uses the docker build will produce identical WASM files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each canister exposes a metrics endpoint which is publicly accessible over the raw
                domain. In each case these metrics include the git commit id which identifies the
                specific source code revision used to build the WASM currently running on that
                canister. For example here is the url of the metrics endpoint for the user index
                canister: https://4bkt6-4aaaa-aaaaf-aaaiq-cai.raw.ic0.app/metrics.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can use dfx to interrogate the sha256 hash of the WASM module for any given
                canister id using the following command:
            </p>

            <code>dfx canister --network ic info 4bkt6-4aaaa-aaaaf-aaaiq-cai </code>

            <p>
                By building the WASM module for a canister at the given git commit, calculating its
                sha256 hash, and comparing with the module hash returned by the IC using dfx, the
                source code running on any canister can be verified.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    the canister ids of the top-level OpenChat canisters can be found in the
                    canister_ids.json file in the root of the OpenChat repo
                </li>
                <li>
                    the canister id of any group canister can be found in the url for that group in
                    the OpenChat app
                </li>
                <li>
                    likewise the canister id of any user canister can be found in the url of a
                    direct chat with that user
                </li>
                <li>
                    your own canister id can be found from the main menu in the advanced section of
                    your profile
