                The OpenChat system is composed of canister smart contracts running on the Internet
                Computer which provides chat functionality. The canisters provide an API and serve
                the assets for the OpenChat web app, and going forwards, will allow 3rd-party
                services to integrate chat. The following diagram shows the OpenChat system in
                orange with its various external dependencies. The blue boxes are services running
                on the Internet Computer and the gray boxes are off-chain.

                The OpenChat system architecture has been driven by both the requirements and by the
                current and anticipated future characteristics of the Internet Computer.

                deployable units. The solid links represent IC updates which go through blockchain
                consensus. The brown boxes are all canisters and the light gray boxes are services
                hosted on AWS.
